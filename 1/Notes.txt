Which JDK (java development kit) to use?
The best choice is LTS (long term support) versions.

Why use a Java LTS version?
* Stability: LTS versions minimize surprises with bugs and security issues already ironed out.
* Support: There is a longer window where official support and updates are guaranteed.
* Ecosystem: Libraries, tools, and frameworks focus their support on LTS versions.
* Regular versions: They have new features and long-term support.

Char data type holds only one character and is enclosed within single quotes.
A char is stored as a 2 byte number, similar to the short. This number is mapped to a single character by Java.
So, when you print a char, you will see the mapped character, and not the representative number.
Java supports a unicode value for characters, which you can use to set a char value.
Unicode is an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts
by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that
applies across different platforms and programs.

symbl.cc has all unicodes for character languages.

When you define a character, you can use both unicode or its character value inside single quotes.

Assigning values to a chr variable:

Assignment Type:            Example Code
a literal character         char myChar = 'D';
a Unicode value             char myChar = '\u0044';
an integer value            char myChar = 68;

String can hold multiple characters and is enclosed within double quotes.

A boolean value allows for two opposite choices, true or false, yes or no, one or zero;

We can use a notepad for writing code, but in case of java, we need a more powerful tool
called IntelliJ or Eclipse

JShell is a standard component for JDK.
It reads the command or code segment we type in.
It evaluates and executes the code, and often allows short cuts to be used.
It prints out the results of the evaluation or execution.
It loops back for more input.

JShell runs in a terminal and is useful for quickly trying out new ideas.

JShell does not replace the need for an IDE.

You can open the JShell by opening cmd and writing jshell, then enter.

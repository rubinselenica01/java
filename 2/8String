A String is a class that contains a sequence of characters.
It is limited by the amount of heap space.
You can use unicode inside a String.

Strings are immutable, that means you can't change a String after it's created.

When concatenating a String, it is not appended, but instead, a new String is created.
The old String will get discarded automatically.

If you are doing multiple appending, java supports a class called StringBuilder.
The StringBuilder class is mutable, meaning it can be changed, but does not share
String's special features.

A keyword is any one of the reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the Java language.

In java language all words are case-sensitive, including the keywords.
An int, in lower case, is not the same as Int with capital I. Both of them are keywords in java used for
different purposes.

Variables are a way to store information in the computer. They can be accessed by a name we give them,
and the computer does the hard work by finding them which are stored in the RAM.

There are lot of data types used for variables, some of them are in keywords list.

The syntax of declaration is: int myFirstNumber = 5;
Semicolons are used to end a statement.

A declaration statement is used to define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name,
then optionally to set the variable to a specific value.

Expression is a coding construct that evaluates to a single value.

To access a value you access it by calling the variable's name.

A literal cannot be changed. A literal is the simplest form of an expression and not a variable.

A redeclaring variable is not allowed.

Java operations, hence the term, perform an operation on a variable value.

Casting means to treat or convert a number, from one type to another. We put the type we want the number
to be, in parentheses like this:
(byte)(myMinByteValue/2);

Java uses the int data type by default for numbers.
So, when we have this statement:
short value = (-128 / 2); //this should work because java detects the number and it fits into short data type

When we have this statement

short myNewShortValue = (myMinShortValue/2); //it will throw error because we need to specify the type conversion
as we said, int is java's default data type.

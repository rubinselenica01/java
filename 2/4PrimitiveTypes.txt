Primitive types are the most basic data types.

The eight primitive data types:

Whole number:   byte
                short
                int
                long

Real number:    float
                double

Single character: char

Boolean value: boolean

A class is a building block for object-oriented programming, and allows us to build custom
data types.

Java uses the concept of a wrapper class, for all its eight primitive data types.
Wrapper classes:    Byte
                    Short
                    Integer
                    Long
                    Float
                    Double
                    Character
                    Boolean

If we try to assign a larger number than the maximum value into an int,
we will create something called overflow situation.
If we try to assign a smaller number than the minimum value into an int,
we will create something called underflow situation.

We can assign to an int the value: 213_321 and the result will still be 213321.

L is required in java when the numeric value of integer exceeds.

We use floating-point numbers when we need more precision in calculations.

There are 2 primitive types: float and double.
double is default java floating point type.

Data type       Width(in bits)      Min Value       Max Value
float               32              1.4E-45         3.4028235E38
double              64              4.9E-324        1.7976931348623157E308

The ranges are shown in java's scientific notation.

1.4E-45 is the same as 1.4 * 10^-45 and 3.4E38 is the same as 3.4 * 10^38.

The double data type can be specified as a numeric literal with a suffix of either lowercase 'd'
or uppercase 'D', but because are the default in java, the suffix is optional to use.

The float data type can be specified as a numeric literal with a suffix of either lowercase 'f'
or uppercase 'F'. This suffix is required if you are assigning a real number to a variable that
was declared with a float type.

Why we should choose double?
1. It is actually faster to process on many modern computers. That's because computers have, at the chip level,
the functionality to actually deal with these double numbers faster than the equivalent float.
2. Java libraries, particularly math functions, are often written to process doubles and not floats, and to
return the result as a double.

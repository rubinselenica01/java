Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods wth the same name, but the methods
are declared with different parameters.

Java can resolve which method is called based on the arguments being passed when the method is invoked.

A method signature consists of the same name of the method, and the uniqueness of the declaration
of its parameters.

A method's return type is not part of the signature.

A parameter name is also not part of the signature.

The type, order, and number of parameters, in conjunction with the name, make a method signature unique.

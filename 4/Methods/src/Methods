A method declares executable code that can be invoked, passing a fixed number of values as arguments.

Benefits:
Reduce code duplications
Can be executed many times with different results, by passing data to the method in the form of arguments.

Parameters are types of variables and their names. Arguments are values that a method takes.

A return statement returns control to the invoker of a method.

The main method is special in Java, because Java's virtual machine (JVM) looks for the method, with this particular signature,
and uses it as the entry point for execution of code.
